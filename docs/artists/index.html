<h1>The Artists</h1>
<div class='left_align'>
<p>We love Baltimore and one of the reasons we love it is because there are so many amazing artists here. Here's a short list of the local artists who we chose to support while planning our wedding.</p>
<h2 class="artist_name"> Artesanias Mexicanas <span class="light">• Flowers</span> </h2>
<a href="http://www.creativealliance.org/blog/2015/12/artesanas-mexicanas" class="artist_site">www.creativealliance.org</a>
<p>Creative Alliance's Artesanas Mexicanas are a group of talented women who are natives of Mexico and residents of Southeast Baltimore. On top of crafting our amazing corn husk flowers, they also provide professional development training in Spanish, bilingual piñata-making workshops at festivals and area schools, and organize traditional Mexican cultural events.</p>
<h2 class="artist_name">Lauren Schott <span class="light">• Rings</span></h2>
<a href="http://www.laurenschott.com/" class="artist_site">www.laurenschott.com</a>
<p>Lauren works closely with her clients to design beautiful jewlery that fits the lifestyle of the person who will be wearing it. Natasha's engagement ring was designed with advice from Ali and incorporates her love for the Chesapeake Bay and the rejuvinating relationship that oysters have for the environment. Ali's wedding band was pressed on an 18th century ring press that Lauren rescued from an old jewlery shop that was going out of buisness years ago.</p>
<h2 class="artist_name">Caleb Luke Lin <span class="light">• Illustration</span></h2>
<a href="http://www.caleblukelin.com/" class="artist_site">www.caleblukelin.com</a>
<p>Caleb Luke Lin is an illustrator based right here in Baltimore, Maryland. He enjoys drawing maps, lettering, patterns, and creatures both real and imagined. Caleb illustrated all the things that Ali and Natasha love about their neighborhood.</p>
<h2 class="artist_name">Sarah Veblen <span class="light"> • Dress</span></h2>
<a href="http://www.sarahveblen.com/" class="artist_site">www.sarahveblen.com</a>
<p>Sarah Veblen is a custom fashion designer who focuses on creating clothing for her clientele and on teaching and writing to promote the craft of garment-making. Sarah customized a beautiful Habesha dress that Tasha bought while in Ethiopia for he wedding dress.</p>
<h2 class="artist_name"> Alicia Wiley <span class="light">• Photography</span></h2>
<a href="https://www.aliciawileyphotography.com/" class="artist_site">www.aliciawileyphotography.com</a>
<p>Alicia is a Baltimore native. She studied environmental science in school but her creative nature compelled her to persue photography. Her versitile and adventurous spirit was essential for capturing the photograph that's on Ali and Natashas's wedding invitation.</p>
